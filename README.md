# About

Oreo Clicker is a game where users click or tap the Oreo and a counter keeps track of how many times they did so.

# Implementation

Coded in Visual Studio Code. HTML used as the markup for output and displaying image of the Oreo cookie and current counter value. Bootstrap was used to layout and style the user interface, Functionality was coded in TypeScript and then complied into JavaScript for a safer development.
